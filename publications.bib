	abstract = {Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved, adaptive component of social behavior. Studies in male mice illustrate that aggression is influenced by numerous factors including the degree to which an individual finds aggression rewarding and will work for access to attack and subordinate mice. While such studies have expanded our understanding of the molecular and circuit mechanisms of male aggression very little is known about female aggression, within these established contexts. Here we use an ethologically relevant model of male vs. female aggression by pair housing adult male and female outbred CFW mice with opposite sex cage mates. We assess reactive (defensive) aggression in the resident intruder (RI) test and appetitive (rewarding) aggression in the aggression conditioned place preference (CPP) and operant self-administration (SA) tests. Our results show dramatic sex differences in both qualitative and quantitative aspects of reactive vs. appetitive aggression. Males exhibit more wrestling and less investigative behavior during RI, find aggression rewarding, and will work for access to a subordinate to attack. Females exhibit more bites, alternate between aggressive behaviors and investigative behaviors more readily during RI, however, they do not find aggression to be rewarding or reinforcing. These results establish sex differences in aggression in mice, providing an important resource for the field to better understand the circuit and molecular mechanisms of aggression in both sexes.},

	abstract = {The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) controls behavior via connections with limbic excitatory afferents that engage various inhibitory motifs to shape mPFC circuit function. The dynorphin (Dyn) / kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) system is highly enriched in the mPFC, and its dysregulation is implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, it is unclear how the Dyn / KOR system modulates excitatory and inhibitory circuits that are integral for mPFC information processing and behavioral control. Here, we provide a circuit-based framework wherein mPFC Dyn / KOR signaling regulates excitation-inhibition balance by toggling which afferents drive mPFC neurons. Dyn / KOR regulation of afferent inputs is pathway-specific. Dyn acting on presynaptic KORs inhibits glutamate release from afferent inputs to the mPFC, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and contralateral cortex. The majority of excitatory synapses to mPFC neurons, including those from the ventral hippocampus (VH), do not express presynaptic KOR, rendering them insensitive to Dyn / KOR modulation. Dyn / KOR signaling also suppresses afferent-driven recruitment of specific inhibitory sub-networks, providing a basis for Dyn to disinhibit mPFC circuits. Specifically, Dyn / KOR signaling preferentially suppresses SST interneuron- relative to PV interneuron-mediated inhibition. Selective KOR action on afferents or within mPFC microcircuits gates how distinct limbic inputs drive spiking in mPFC neurons. Presynaptic Dyn / KOR signaling decreases KOR-positive input-driven (e.g. BLA) spiking of mPFC neurons. In contrast, KOR-negative input recruitment of mPFC neurons is enhanced by Dyn / KOR signaling via suppression of mPFC inhibitory microcircuits. Thus, by acting on distinct circuit elements, Dyn / KOR signaling shifts KOR-positive and negative afferent control of mPFC circuits, providing mechanistic insights into the role of neuropeptides in shaping mPFC function. Together, these findings highlight the utility of targeting the mPFC Dyn / KOR system as a means to treat neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulation in mPFC integration of long-range afferents with local inhibitory microcircuits.},

	abstract = {Dopamine (DA) release in striatal circuits, including the nucleus accumbens medial shell (mNAcSh), tracks separable features of reward like motivation and reinforcement. However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which DA receptors transform DA release into distinct constructs of reward remain unclear. Here we show that DA D3 receptor (D3R) signaling in the mNAcSh drives motivated behavior in mice by regulating local microcircuits. Furthermore, D3Rs coexpress with DA D1 receptors, which regulate reinforcement, but not motivation. Paralleling dissociable roles in reward function, we report nonoverlapping physiological actions of D3R and DA D1 receptor signaling in mNAcSh neurons. Our results establish a fundamental framework wherein DA signaling within the same nucleus accumbens cell type is physiologically compartmentalized via actions on distinct DA receptors. This structural and functional organization provides neurons in a limbic circuit with the unique ability to orchestrate dissociable aspects of reward-related behaviors relevant to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Background
A key challenge in developing treatments for neuropsychiatric illness is the disconnect between preclinical models and the complexity of human social behavior. We integrate voluntary social self-administration into a rodent model of social stress as a platform for the identification of fundamental brain and behavior mechanisms underlying stress-induced individual differences in social motivation.
Methods
Here, we introduced an operant social stress procedure in male and female mice composed of 3 phases: 1) social self-administration training, 2) social stress exposure concurrent with reinforced self-administration testing, and 3) poststress operant testing under nonreinforced and reinforced conditions. We used social-defeat and witness-defeat stress in male and female mice.
Results
Social defeat attenuated social reward seeking in males but not females, whereas witness defeat had no effect in males but promoted seeking behavior in females. We resolved social stress-induced changes to social motivation by aggregating z-scored operant metrics into a cumulative social index score to describe the spectrum of individual differences exhibited during operant social stress. Clustering does not adequately describe the relative distributions of social motivation following stress and is better described as a nonbinary behavioral distribution defined by the social index score, capturing a dynamic range of stress-related alterations in social motivation inclusive of sex as a biological variable.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that operant social stress can detect stable individual differences in stress-induced changes to social motivation. The inclusion of volitional behavior in social procedures may enhance the understanding of behavioral adaptations that promote stress resiliency and their mechanisms under more naturalistic conditions.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for neurodegeneration, however little is known about how this kind of injury alters neuron subtypes. In this study, we follow neuronal populations over time after a single mild TBI (mTBI) to assess long ranging consequences of injury at the level of single, transcriptionally defined neuronal classes. We find that the stress-responsive Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) defines a population of cortical neurons after mTBI. Using an inducible reporter linked to ATF3, we genetically mark these damaged cells to track them over time. We find that a population in layer V undergoes cell death acutely after injury, while another in layer II/III survives long term and remains electrically active. To investigate the mechanism controlling layer V neuron death, we genetically silenced candidate stress response pathways. We found that the axon injury responsive dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) is required for the layer V neuron death. This work provides a rationale for targeting the DLK signaling pathway as a therapeutic intervention for traumatic brain injury. Beyond this, our approach to track neurons after a mild, subclinical injury can inform our understanding of neuronal susceptibility to repeated impacts.},

	abstract = {In many mammalian species, female behavior towards infant conspecifics changes across reproductive stages. Sexually naïve females interact minimally or aggressively with infants, whereas the same animals exhibit extensive care behavior, even towards unrelated infants, after parturition1–6. Here, we discovered that two distinct sets of serotonin neurons collectively mediate this dramatic transition in maternal behavior—serotonin neurons projecting to the medial preoptic area (mPOA) promote pup care in mothers, whereas those projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) suppress pup interaction in virgin female mice. Disrupting serotonin synthesis in either of these subpopulations or stimulating either subpopulation is sufficient to toggle pup-directed behavior between that displayed by virgin females and that of lactating mothers. In virgin female mice, the first pup interaction triggers an increase in serotonin release in BNST but a decrease in mPOA. In mothers, serotonin activity becomes greatly elevated in mPOA during pup interactions. Acute interruption of serotonin signaling locally in either mPOA or BNST disrupts the stage-dependent switch in pup care. Together, these results highlight how functionally distinct serotonin subpopulations orchestrate social behaviors appropriate for a given reproductive state, and suggest a circuit logic for how a neuromodulator coordinates adaptive behavioral changes across life stages.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.National Institutes of Health, 1R01NS131987-01},

	abstract = {Dynamic functional connectivity between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is essential for spatial working memory (SWM). Interactions between vHPC projections and mPFC interneurons, and their plasticity, are uniquely positioned to influence SWM, yet the nature of these interactions remains unclear. Here, we combined in vivo optical stimulation of vHPC inputs to mPFC with calcium recordings of discrete mPFC interneuron populations in mice, revealing class-specific response profiles and plasticity. Repeated vHPC input stimulation persistently depressed activity in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons and potentiated activity in somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed that these divergent effects likely arise from a primary weakening of monosynaptic vHPC input onto VIP interneurons. Leveraging this plasticity to inform the circuit interactions that support SWM, we found that mice with prior vHPC input stimulation displayed elevated VIP interneuron activity during the delay epoch in early SWM task training, and this enhanced activity correlated with poorer training performance. Accordingly, mice modeling the schizophrenia-predisposing 22q11.2 deletion syndrome with known SWM learning deficits recapitulated this aberrant VIP interneuron activity profile and showed reduced vHPC targeting of mPFC VIP interneurons. Together, these findings reveal novel cell-type-specific plasticity in cognition-supporting circuits and illustrate how reweighting of inputs to VIP interneurons may contribute to working memory dysfunction.IN BRIEF Silverstein et al. investigated how ventral hippocampus (vHPC) inputs to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interact with mPFC interneuron populations to support spatial working memory (SWM) in mice. They show that repeated vHPC input stimulation that reduces vHPC drive onto vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons also elevates delay-related VIP interneuron activity in early SWM task training, and this enhanced activity correlates with poorer training performance. Mice modelling the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome—known to have SWM learning deficits—recapitulate this altered VIP interneuron activity and show reduced vHPC input targeting of VIP interneurons.HIGHLIGHTSRepeated stimulation of vHPC inputs to mPFC persistently depresses VIP interneuron activity and enhances SST interneuron activity in miceBlunted monosynaptic drive onto mPFC VIP interneurons by repeated vHPC input stimulation plausibly reproduces in vivo activity changesStimulated mice show heightened VIP interneuron activity during the delay epoch in early SWM task training that correlates with poorer training performanceMice modeling the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome with known SWM task learning deficits mirror this aberrant VIP interneuron activity profile and show reduced vHPC input targeting of VIP interneuronsCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.NINDS Division of Intramural Research, ZIA NS003168NIMH Division of Intramural Research, ZIA MH002970NIDA Division of Intramural Research, ZIA DA000511},
