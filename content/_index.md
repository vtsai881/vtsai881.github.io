            Used the high resolution cellular and molecular neuroscience techniques ex vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology and in-situ hybridization in combination with fiber photometry recordings and 2-photon imaging during headfixed behavior assays to comprehensively characterize the role of endogenous opioids and their receptors in shaping prefrontocortical microcircuits involved in motivated behavior. Set up hardware and software for video acquisition and wrote simple computer vision- based tools for video processing. Set up and implemented computational behavioral quantification methods and taught researchers across institutes to use them in their own research.

        As of [early 2025](https://x.com/NIH/status/1888004759396958263), institutional research funding has been [cut](https://theconversation.com/proposed-cuts-to-nih-funding-would-have-ripple-effects-on-research-that-could-hamper-the-us-for-decades-262419) [ dramatically](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03994-z). This already is and will continue be massively destructive to the progress of science as a whole, and the livelihood of researchers, their families, and patient participants hoping to discover cures. Research described in the following articles and the research I have conducted in the past, as well as what I conduct now would not have been possible without research funding from the government. Please take the time to reach [out](https://twitter.com/doristsao/status/1783669451533242526) to your Senators and Representatives ([example template from Twitter here](https://twitter.com/BrainsExplained/status/1779582134115561603)).
