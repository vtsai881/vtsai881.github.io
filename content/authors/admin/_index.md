Hi, I'm Valerie! I am a first year Neuroscience PhD Student at Stanford University. I am interested in using computational modeling and closed-loop optogenetics to define the structure of the circuits, systems, and motor sequences underlying social behavior.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I did my undergrad at the University of Washington, where I earned a Neuroscience BS and an English Minor. I conducted an honors thesis research project with Dr. Sam Golden where I used deep and machine learning to quantitatively phenotype the behavioral sequences and whole-brain cfos ensembles underlying maladaptive aggression. I was also Editor-in-Chief of [Grey Matters Journal](https://greymattersjournal.org/), a neuroscience outreach organization founded and run by undergraduate students aimed at fostering scientific engagement through community outreach, diversity and inclusivity initiatives, and effective scientific communication.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

After graduating in 2022, I worked at the National Institute of Mental Health as an IRTA Post-Baccalaureate Research Fellow in the Unit on Neuromodulation and Synaptic Integration, where I learned to use patch clamp electrophysiology and one- and two-photon microscopy to investigate the impact of endogenous opioid signaling on PFC microcircuitry and motivated behavior.
