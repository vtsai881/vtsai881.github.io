abstract: Dopamine release in striatal circuits, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc),
  tracks separable features of reward such as motivation and reinforcement. However,
  the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which dopamine receptors transform dopamine
  release into distinct constructs of reward remain unclear. Here, we show that dopamine
  D3 receptor (D3R) signaling in the NAc drives motivated behavior by regulating local
  NAc microcircuits. Furthermore, D3Rs co-express with dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs),
  which regulate reinforcement, but not motivation. Paralleling dissociable roles
  in reward function, we report non-overlapping physiological actions of D3R and D1R
  signaling in NAc neurons. Our results establish a novel cellular framework wherein
  dopamine signaling within the same NAc cell type is physiologically compartmentalized
  via actions on distinct dopamine receptors. This structural and functional organization
  provides neurons in a limbic circuit with the unique ability to orchestrate dissociable
  aspects of reward-related behaviors that are relevant to the etiology of neuropsychiatric
  disorders.
