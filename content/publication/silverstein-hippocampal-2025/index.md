abstract: Dynamic functional connectivity between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and
  medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is essential for spatial working memory (SWM). Interactions
  between vHPC projections and mPFC interneurons, and their plasticity, are uniquely
  positioned to influence SWM, yet the nature of these interactions remains unclear.
  Here, we combined in vivo optical stimulation of vHPC inputs to mPFC with calcium
  recordings of discrete mPFC interneuron populations in mice, revealing class-specific
  response profiles and plasticity. Repeated vHPC input stimulation persistently depressed
  activity in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons and potentiated
  activity in somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology
  and computational modeling revealed that these divergent effects likely arise from
  a primary weakening of monosynaptic vHPC input onto VIP interneurons. Leveraging
  this plasticity to inform the circuit interactions that support SWM, we found that
  mice with prior vHPC input stimulation displayed elevated VIP interneuron activity
  during the delay epoch in early SWM task training, and this enhanced activity correlated
  with poorer training performance. Accordingly, mice modeling the schizophrenia-predisposing
  22q11.2 deletion syndrome with known SWM learning deficits recapitulated this aberrant
  VIP interneuron activity profile and showed reduced vHPC targeting of mPFC VIP interneurons.
  Together, these findings reveal novel cell-type-specific plasticity in cognition-supporting
  circuits and illustrate how reweighting of inputs to VIP interneurons may contribute
  to working memory dysfunction.IN BRIEF Silverstein et al. investigated how ventral
  hippocampus (vHPC) inputs to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interact with mPFC
  interneuron populations to support spatial working memory (SWM) in mice. They show
  that repeated vHPC input stimulation that reduces vHPC drive onto vasoactive intestinal
  peptide (VIP) interneurons also elevates delay-related VIP interneuron activity
  in early SWM task training, and this enhanced activity correlates with poorer training
  performance. Mice modelling the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome—known to have SWM learning
  deficits—recapitulate this altered VIP interneuron activity and show reduced vHPC
  input targeting of VIP interneurons.HIGHLIGHTSRepeated stimulation of vHPC inputs
  to mPFC persistently depresses VIP interneuron activity and enhances SST interneuron
  activity in miceBlunted monosynaptic drive onto mPFC VIP interneurons by repeated
  vHPC input stimulation plausibly reproduces in vivo activity changesStimulated mice
  show heightened VIP interneuron activity during the delay epoch in early SWM task
  training that correlates with poorer training performanceMice modeling the 22q11.2
  deletion syndrome with known SWM task learning deficits mirror this aberrant VIP
  interneuron activity profile and show reduced vHPC input targeting of VIP interneuronsCompeting
